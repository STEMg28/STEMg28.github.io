    * Utilize multiple software applications and equipment to document and record sensitive information
    * Manage multiple priorities independently with minimal supervision
    * Work with frontline team of 5 to ensure quality service and consistent information shared among members


Undergraduate Experience
======
* February 2020: Australian Fires & Flooding News Report – Urban Ecosystems Project 
  * UMBC, Department of Geography and Environmental Systems
  * Advisor: Dr. Alan Yeakley          
      * Respond to inquiries by thorough research and resolve issues during student interactions
      * Utilize multiple software applications and equipment to document and record sensitive information
      * Manage multiple priorities independently with minimal supervision
      * Work with frontline team of 5 to ensure quality service and consistent information shared among members

* Spring 2019: Water Quality & Algae Analysis – Lab & Field Techniques in Environmental Science Project 
  * UMBC, Department of Geography and Environmental Systems
  * Advisor: Dr. Kenneth Belt                
      * Work in a research team of 3 members to compare two local campus pond ecosystems
      * Take multiple water samples from both sites utilizing LabQuest to conduct pH and turbidity measurements
      * Perform 2 Coli scan tests for E. coli detection in water samples
      * The analytical tests determined that algae flourish in less turbid water that has higher pH levels  

* July 2018: Bath Bombs - Chemical Engineering Analysis Project
